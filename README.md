Sustainable Fitness
A health and exercise website focused on relatable and sustainable forms of exercise, fitness, healthy habits and nutrition. Exercise and health should not be considered a chore or something that is required, it should be seen as something more fun, exciting and something people look forward to. This aims to inform and give information on how to lower the bar or lower the entry to sustainable healthy habits.
