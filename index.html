    <h1  id="top">Sustainable Fitness</h1>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
    <p>Thinking of fitness often conjures thoughts of sweating it out at the gym or fitness instagrammers telling you to 
     push through the pain, find the time or have better priorities when it comes the fitness and food. 
     <br>
     Most people don't immediately think of their favourite outdoor activity when it comes to thinking about fitness. 
     Most people aren't particularly upset when they can't go to the gym, or miss a bodypump session. 
     Imagine instead of squeezing your activity into the day, you actively plan your time around trying to exercise. 
     <br>
     The simple question to find out if your exercise regime at the minute is sustainable is: "Can I keep this up for the
     next five years?". If the answer is no, then it's probably not sustainable. <span>&#9829</span>

    <h2>Why Should Fitness be Sustainable?</h2>
    <p> The physical and mental benefits of exercise on a daily basis give a reduced incidence rate of mental and phyiscial 
        disease. Being able to move more without restriction, or do the things you want to for as long as you can seem 
        like the best reasons to try to stay healthy. 
    </p>
    <h2>Is There a Minimum Amount of Fitness?</h2>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 2%;">There no easy answer to this question. The easiest way to think about this would be to frame what level of fitness
        you require in terms of what activities you want to engage in. Do want to walk for 30 minutes a day? Can you? 
        Then according to your own metric, you are fit enough.
